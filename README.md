## Supported versions

Due to copyright law, I cannot include the original graphics.

The project works with:

- NINA ("Neue Inseln, Neue Abenteuer")
- History Edition

## Build instructions

**For different reasons, two files (`base.json`, `buildings.json`) are currently missing for a build. Let me know if these are needed.**

The file `benno.properties` must be edited. Enter the correct path to the savegames and the game there.
